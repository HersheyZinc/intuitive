## Introduction
The rapid changes in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has prompted organizations to accelerate their digital transformation initiatives. Organizational employees, including the change management professionals themselves, face the need to upskill and incorporate AI tools into their workflows. Consequently, our team proposes the Change Management Dashboard - an AI platform to assist change management professionals in strategizing and communicating business impacts. Overall, our proposed solution comprises of the following features:
    1. A Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot with expertise in change management.
    2. An interactive dashboard to analyze and summarize employee feedback.
    3. A deployment simulation to predict employee response to new policies.
    4. An iterative framework for continuously refining change management policies based on employee feedback.


## How to use
1. install the required dependencies using `pip install requirements.txt`
2. run the streamlit web application with `streamlit run demo.py`
